You should temporarily disable VPNs or firewalls **on both Windows (your computer) and Android (your phone)** if they are being used. Here's how to do it for each device:

---

### **On Windows (Computer):**

#### **Disable VPN:**
1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Go to **Network & Internet > VPN**.
3. If there’s an active VPN, disconnect it.

#### **Disable Firewall (Temporary):**
1. Press **Win + S**, type `Windows Defender Firewall`, and select it.
2. Click **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** in the left panel.
3. Select **Turn off Windows Defender Firewall (not recommended)** for both private and public networks.
4. Click **OK**.

*Remember to turn the firewall back on once you’ve tested your Expo app.*

### **On Android (Phone):**

#### **Disable VPN:**
1. Open **Settings**.
2. Go to **Network & Internet** or **Connections** (depending on your phone model).
3. Tap **VPN**.
4. If there’s an active VPN, disconnect it.

#### **Disable Private DNS (Optional):**
1. Open **Settings**.
2. Go to **Network & Internet > Private DNS**.
3. Set it to **Off**.

### Why Disable Both?  
Expo Go relies on a direct connection between your computer and phone. If either device has a VPN or firewall blocking the connection, the Expo Go app may fail to load your project.

After disabling these, restart your Expo development server and try again. Let me know if the issue persists!
